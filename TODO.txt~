TODO LIST:

	- Check the data and physics params. 
		- Is Boyle data right?
		-
	- Data:
		- unsolved asymptotics in number theory?
		- logistic map -- recover the equation, even when it looks like garbage
		- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ives%E2%80%93Stilwell_experiment

	- Save the MCMC state and allow resuming
	- Debug and optimize insert/delete
	- print out the maximum LL possible (based on SDs)
