TODO LIST:
- Data:
	- unsolved asymptotics in number theory?
	- logistic map -- recover the equation, even when it looks like garbage
	- density of squarefree integers ( 6 / pi^2 -- approximate a constant)
	- 
	
- Make different languages -- trig, physical constants, number theory, etc 

- functions: floor, abs, mod, sign

 - Fix casting of data_t throughout f_output
 - Save the MCMC state and allow resuming
 - Debug and optimize insert/delete
 - Migrate to using primitives.cu
 - print out the maximum LL possible (based on SDs)
 
 - What about another prior: 
	- the depth of embedding of the variable should matter -- x+log(1) should be simpler than 1+log(x)
	- so the probability of x-vs-1 should depend on depth.
