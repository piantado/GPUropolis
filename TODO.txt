TODO LIST:


	- Have a better scheme for temperatures, schedules, resampling and things!
	
	- Hmm the Boyle data doesn't seem to be right...
	- Or the COBE -- are these units right?
	
	- Data:
		- unsolved asymptotics in number theory?
		- logistic map -- recover the equation, even when it looks like garbage
		- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ives%E2%80%93Stilwell_experiment

	- Save the MCMC state and allow resuming
	- Debug and optimize insert/delete
	- print out the maximum LL possible (based on SDs)
